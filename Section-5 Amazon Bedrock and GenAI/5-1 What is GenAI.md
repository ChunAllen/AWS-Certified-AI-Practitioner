### Generative AI
- is a subset of Deep Learning
- used to generate new data that is similar to the data it was trained on
    - Text
    - Image
    - Audio
    - Code
    - Video
- Example Use Case: Unlabeled Data can be trained using Foundation Model to 
    - Generate Text
    - Summarize Text
    - Information Extraction
    - Image Generation
    - Chatbot
    - Question Answering

#### Foundation Model
- To generate data, we must rely on Foundation Model
- FM are trained on wide variety of input data
- The models may cost tens of millions of dollars to train
- Example FMs:
    - GPT4.0
    - Claude Sonnet
    - Gemini Flash

#### Large Language Models (LLM)
- Type of AI designed to generate coherent human-like text
- One notable example: GPT-4 (ChatGPT / Open AI)
- Can perform languare-related tasks

- How It Works:
    - Receives the prompt from the user
    - Model will leverage all the existing content it has learned from to generate new content
    - LLM answers in a **Non-Deterministic** way. The generate text may be different for every user that uses the same prompt
